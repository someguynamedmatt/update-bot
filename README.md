# Update Bot

Update Bot ðŸ¤– is a Github utility which uses CircleCi 2's [cron](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#scheduling-a-workflow) functionality to continuously update pull requests (PRs) if they become out of date. This helps keep Pull Requests up-to-date for testing and deploying purposes.

Once Setup, add the Github Tag 'AUTOUPDATE' to the PR and forget about updating the PR every again!

## Initial Setup

The sentences below describe how to setup Update Bot.

### Install

```sh

npm i update-bot --save-dev

```

### Add a `GITHUB_ORG` env var

Add a `GITHUB_ORG` environment variable to the CircleCi workflow you want to use **Update Bot** on.

The `GITHUB_ORG` environment variable is a Github Organization or User that repository exists under.

In example, this repository is under `someguynamedmatt` so the `GITHUB_ORG` environment variable would be `someguynamedmatt`.

### Add a `GITHB_TOKEN` env var

Add a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the CircleCi workflow you want to use **Update Bot** on.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is generated by the org or user in Github. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` used to authenticate **Update Bot** to update repositories.

### Add a 'AUTOUPDATE' tag to a Pull Request

Make a Github Repository Tag called 'AUTOUPDATE'. Add the tag to Pull Requests to auto-update them. ðŸš€
